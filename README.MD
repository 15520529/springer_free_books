## Python script to download all Springer books released for free during the 2020 COVID-19 quarantine

Just change the folder variable to the folder you want the books downloaded and run the scripts.

If you want just one or two specific books, get the excel file from the folowing link and download just those: https://resource-cms.springernature.com/springer-cms/rest/v1/content/17858272/data/v3

Now updated to also download epub files if it's available.

The books are now organized in sub folders according to the subject ("English Package Name" column).

It took about 1.5 hours to complete the 409 english books (7.2 GB) on my machine.

Thanks Springer!
